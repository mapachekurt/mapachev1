"""
Tools for Agent Builder Pro.

Currently, Agent Builder Pro relies on RAG (Gemini File Search) for knowledge access
and doesn't require additional custom tools. This directory is available for future
tool additions if needed.

Example tools that could be added:
- Code execution tools
- File system operations
- API integrations
- Database queries
